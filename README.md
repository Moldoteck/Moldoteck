<!--### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently trying to 
- learn german (hope it's not just a dream to speak B2 level sometime in future)
- research Switzerland's job market (almost got into Google, but that damn recession...)
- learn Rust (similar to C++ in some ways, so shouldn't be too hard I guess)

\backpage - an attempt of a 'looking back' style blog
